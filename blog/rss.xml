            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since graduating from the <strong>Amrita School of Engineering</strong> and starting my career at <strong>SAP Ariba</strong>, I was fascinated by how complex systems could be broken down into clear, usable guides and thoughtful documentation. My path to tech writing wasn't planned—it grew naturally from a desire to <strong>bridge the gap between code and people</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-my-early-engineering-days">🎓 My Early Engineering Days<a href="https://anandnr47.github.io/tech-writer-47-docs-as-code/blog/my-journey-to-tech-writing#-my-early-engineering-days" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🎓 My Early Engineering Days" title="Direct link to 🎓 My Early Engineering Days">​</a></h2>
<p>At university, I thrived on solving technical problems. Between labs and assignments, I started writing technical posts for classmates—whether explaining networking concepts or breaking down programming assignments. That early experience taught me how to <strong>structure ideas for readability and clarity</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-first-steps-at-infosysedgeverve">🔧 First Steps at Infosys/Edgeverve<a href="https://anandnr47.github.io/tech-writer-47-docs-as-code/blog/my-journey-to-tech-writing#-first-steps-at-infosysedgeverve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔧 First Steps at Infosys/Edgeverve" title="Direct link to 🔧 First Steps at Infosys/Edgeverve">​</a></h2>
<p>I joined Infosys right out of campus and worked on their cloud projects. In addition to coding, my work also involved contributing to FRD, BRD, or migration documents. I got an opportunity to move to the technical writing domain as part of internal job transfer. Joining Edgeverve as an Content Writer marked a crucial turning point. My role involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing and updating API docs.</li>
<li>Creating user-focused guides for Finacle.</li>
<li>Collaborating closely with developers and UX designers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t just documentation—it was about creating <strong>practical resources</strong> that help people work smarter.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-embracing-docs-as-code">🧩 Embracing “Docs as Code”<a href="https://anandnr47.github.io/tech-writer-47-docs-as-code/blog/my-journey-to-tech-writing#-embracing-docs-as-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🧩 Embracing “Docs as Code”" title="Direct link to 🧩 Embracing “Docs as Code”">​</a></h2>
<p>As I refined my skills, I have started experimenting (in my personal time, of course) with “Docs as Code” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>💾 <strong>Markdown + Git</strong> for version-controlled writing.</li>
<li>⚙️ <strong>Docusaurus</strong> to build sleek, structured documentation sites.</li>
<li>🤖 <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> to automate review and deployment workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>This integration of documentation into development workflows significantly increases consistency and maintains quality.</p>

<p>I love how tech writing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unpacks tech into human-friendly language.</li>
<li>Keeps evolving—every release is a new story to tell.</li>
<li>Enhances developer experience and user satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good docs aren’t just user-help—they’re a <strong>driver of adoption and delight</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crafting clear API and user-centric documentation.</li>
<li>Creating tutorials, videos, and UX copy.</li>
<li>Contributing to docs ecosystems that scale with features.</li>
</ul>
<p>And my goal stays constant: <strong>to make technology approachable and powerful for everyone</strong>.</p>
