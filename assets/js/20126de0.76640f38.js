My path to tech writing wasn\'t planned\u2014it grew naturally from a desire to **bridge the gap between code and people**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## My Early Engineering Days\\r\\n\\r\\nAt university, I thrived on solving technical problems. Between labs and assignments, I started writing technical posts for classmates\u2014whether explaining networking concepts or breaking down programming assignments. That early experience taught me how to **structure ideas for readability and clarity**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## First Steps at Infosys/Edgeverve\\r\\n\\r\\nI joined Infosys right out of campus and worked on their cloud projects. In addition to coding, my work also involved contributing to FRD, BRD, or migration documents. I got an opportunity to move to the technical writing domain as part of internal job transfer. Joining Edgeverve as an Content Writer marked a crucial turning point. My role involved:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Writing and updating API docs.\\r\\n- Creating user-focused guides for Finacle.\\r\\n- Collaborating closely with developers and UX designers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wasn\u2019t just documentation\u2014it was about creating **practical resources** that help people work smarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Embracing \u201cDocs as Code\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I refined my skills, I have started experimenting (in my personal time, of course) with \u201cDocs as Code\u201d approach:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Markdown + Git** for version-controlled writing.\\r\\n- **Docusaurus** to build sleek, structured documentation sites.\\r\\n- **CI/CD pipelines** to automate review and deployment workflows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis integration of documentation into development workflows significantly increases consistency and maintains quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why I Chose This Path\\r\\n\\r\\nI love how tech writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Unpacks tech into human-friendly language.\\r\\n2. Keeps evolving\u2014every release is a new story to tell.\\r\\n3. Enhances developer experience and user satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood docs aren\u2019t just user-help\u2014they\u2019re a **driver of adoption and delight**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## What I\u2019m Focused On Today\\r\\n\\r\\n- Crafting clear API and user-centric documentation.\\r\\n- Creating tutorials, videos, and UX copy.\\r\\n- Contributing to docs ecosystems that scale with features.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd my goal stays constant: **to make technology approachable and powerful for everyone**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\u2019re curious about building docs as code or discussing technical content, I\u2019d love to connect!  \\r\\nFeel free to reach out on \ud83d\udd17 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anand-athankavil/).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n> *\u201cTreat documentation like code\u2014to ensure it\u2019s versioned, reviewed, and continuously improved.\u201d*\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading\u2014here\u2019s to the next chapter in clear, impactful communication!"}]}}')}}]);
