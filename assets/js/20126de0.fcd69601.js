My path to tech writing wasn\'t planned\u2014it grew naturally from a desire to **bridge the gap between code and people**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf93 My Early Engineering Days\\n\\nAt university, I thrived on solving technical problems. Between labs and assignments, I started writing technical posts for classmates\u2014whether explaining networking concepts or breaking down programming assignments. That early experience taught me how to **structure ideas for readability and clarity**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 First Steps at Infosys/Edgeverve\\n\\nI joined Infosys right out of campus and worked on their cloud projects. In addition to coding, my work also involved contributing to FRD, BRD, or migration documents. I got an opportunity to move to the technical writing domain as part of internal job transfer. Joining Edgeverve as an Content Writer marked a crucial turning point. My role involved:\\n\\n- Writing and updating API docs.\\n- Creating user-focused guides for Finacle.\\n- Collaborating closely with developers and UX designers.\\n\\nThis wasn\u2019t just documentation\u2014it was about creating **practical resources** that help people work smarter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\udde9 Embracing \u201cDocs as Code\u201d\\n\\nAs I refined my skills, I have started experimenting (in my personal time, of course) with \u201cDocs as Code\u201d approach:\\n\\n- \ud83d\udcbe **Markdown + Git** for version-controlled writing.\\n- \u2699\ufe0f **Docusaurus** to build sleek, structured documentation sites.\\n- \ud83e\udd16 **CI/CD pipelines** to automate review and deployment workflows.\\n\\nThis integration of documentation into development workflows significantly increases consistency and maintains quality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf31 Why I Chose This Path\\n\\nI love how tech writing:\\n\\n1. Unpacks tech into human-friendly language.\\n2. Keeps evolving\u2014every release is a new story to tell.\\n3. Enhances developer experience and user satisfaction.\\n\\nGood docs aren\u2019t just user-help\u2014they\u2019re a **driver of adoption and delight**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What I\u2019m Focused On Today\\n\\n- Crafting clear API and user-centric documentation.\\n- Creating tutorials, videos, and UX copy.\\n- Contributing to docs ecosystems that scale with features.\\n\\nAnd my goal stays constant: **to make technology approachable and powerful for everyone**.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you\u2019re curious about building docs as code or discussing technical content, I\u2019d love to connect!  \\nFeel free to reach out on \ud83d\udd17 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anand-athankavil/).\\n\\n---\\n\\n> *\u201cTreat documentation like code\u2014to ensure it\u2019s versioned, reviewed, and continuously improved.\u201d*\\n\\nThanks for reading\u2014here\u2019s to the next chapter in clear, impactful communication!"}]}}')}}]);
